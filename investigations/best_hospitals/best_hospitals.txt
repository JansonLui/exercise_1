#Answer: After joining the hospital table with the effective_care table, I was able to query the highest average score for various procedures 
as well as the maximum, minimum and sum of all procedures offered at each hospital. I used the average score for this question 
since each hospital offers a variety of procedures. So by averaging the scores and sorting by them, we can determine the supposedly 10 best overall hospitals.
