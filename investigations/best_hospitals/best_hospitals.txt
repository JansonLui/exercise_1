#Question: What hospitals are models of high-quality care? That is, which hospitals have the most consistently high scores for a variety of procedures

#Answer: After joining the hospital table with the effective_care table, I was able to query the highest average score for various procedures as well as the maximum, minimum and sum 
of all procedures offered at each hospital. I used the average score for this question since each hospital offers a variety of procedures. 
So by averaging the scores and sorting by them, we can determine the supposedly 10 best overall hospitals.
