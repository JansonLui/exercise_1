#Answer: After joining the hospital table with the effective_readmissions_care table, I was able to query the highest average score for various procedures 
as well as the maximum, minimum and sum of all procedures offered at each hospital. I used the average score for this question 
since each hospital offers a variety of procedures. The names of the variety of procedures were not important as the question only wanted the scores.
So by averaging the scores and sorting by them, we can determine the top 10 hospitals that possess high-quality care.
