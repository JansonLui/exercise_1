#Answer:
For this question, I am comparing average scores for hospital quality instead of procedural variability because the amount of different 
procedures should not affect survey responses of how well the communication from the doctor improved or how responsive the nurses were. 
It makes more sense to test if there is a relationship with average score in hospital quality and survey responses. 
In my query, I am comparing the average scores of quality with the overall hospital achievement, improvement, dimension scores 
along with the base score and consistency score. This query is different than the original query for the highest average score because
there are some hospitals that did not have survey data so we are comparing hospitals that do have that data. Based on the data, it looks 
like there might be a relationship between average quality score and patient survey responses. For the top hospital, Falls Community Hospital
and Clinic, had the highest average score of 170.91 but has a 2 in  overall achievement, improvement and dimension scores. This could mean
that they're at a point where they aren't able to progress much when since the surveys were last taken. On the contrary to the overall scores, 
the base score of 62 was consistent 18 times throughout the data which is high considering the scores from the other hospitals. 
There also seems to be a trend with the other hospitals as well. The lower the average score, the lower the base score. 
In reference to the hospitals, the overall achievement, improvement and dimension scores only offer additional insight as to how much 
they've progressed since the last time the hospital was surveyed. Again, there seems to be a correlation between average score and patient 
survey responses but without further analysis we cannot be certain.
