#Answer: For this questions, I chose to utilize the state column from hospitals and the average of the score column from effective_care.
Same with question 1, each state and hospital provides different services so an average of the scores is the best choice for a broad question like this.
From the query, these are the 10 best states for models of high-quality care. The state that has the highest quality of care is DC. It makes sense because 
this is where all the important government officials congregate and/or live (including President Obama). In addition, most government officials are older 
in age, so having high-quality-care in DC is not surprising.
