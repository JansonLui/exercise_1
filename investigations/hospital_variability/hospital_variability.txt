#Answer:
For this question, I queried and sorted the procedures that had the most difference in maximum and minimum scores
amongst all hospitals. The results from this query show the top 10 procedures that varied most in scores. The top 
procedure being the decision for time of departure having one of the most varied score makes sense because there are 
people that believe they didn't need to stay in the hospital for as long as they did and vice versa. It also looks like
Venous Thromboembolism Prophylaxis is is also a procedure with big variance in scores. This is actually a surgery for treating
blood clots in big blood veins. As with the nature of surgery, there are people that dislike the thought of it as well as people
that praise being operated on in an attempt to get better. Hence the variability in score. Although it does not take into account 
the number of occurences, this query still shows good insight as to possible improvements that could be made to these processes.
